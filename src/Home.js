            <p>
              Youâ€™ve been carrying so much. Always showing up. Always giving.
              Always holding it together. But deep inside, you know: this canâ€™t
              be all there is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, you are invited to pause. To exhale. To feel your body
              soften and your soul expand.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold">Serap with Love</span> is more
              than a practice â€“ itâ€™s a sanctuary. A place where healing becomes
              simple, where your nervous system can unwind, and where you are
              reminded of the truth: you are not broken. You are whole.
            </p>

          <p>
            I didnâ€™t have an easy start in life. And maybe thatâ€™s why I began
            searching early â€“ for depth, for truth, for a sense of belonging
            inside myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            That longing became my compass. It carried me through crises,
            through burnout, through times when I thought I had lost myself. And
            it led me into the healing worlds of psychology, yoga, meditation,
            breathwork, EFT, and energy work.
          </p>
          <p>
            With every practice, with every layer I released, I came closer to
            something essential: my own essence. The quiet strength that had
            always been there. The inner home I had been longing for all along.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I guide women who are ready for the same journey â€“ back to
            themselves. <span className="font-semibold">Serap with Love</span>{" "}
            is my way of sharing not just tools, but lived experience, embodied
            presence, and the deep knowing that true healing always begins
            within.
