        For me, yoga is not about bending your body into perfect shapes. It’s
        about meeting yourself – exactly as you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I discovered yoga, I found a practice that gave me both grounding
        and freedom. Through Yin Yoga, Hatha, and breathwork, I learned how to
        listen to my body’s whispers, how to release what I had been holding
        for too long, and how to breathe myself back into safety.

        My classes are a soft landing place. They are an invitation to slow
        down, to let go of tension, to reconnect with your body’s wisdom. Each
        session is a reminder that healing is not about performance – it’s
        about presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come as you are. Leave lighter, calmer, and more connected.
